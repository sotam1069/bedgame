#CIIC 3015 Project 2 (2021)
## Made by Pedro Matos

The project is to   write   an   interactive   simulation  text   adventure   game  of   someone   who   comes   home   and   wants   to   go   to   sleep. 
If   the   user   manages   to   fall   asleep,   they   win!   The   simulation   works   as   follows:
Your   user   must   navigate   and   interact   with   an   environment   consisting   of   their   front   door,   living   room,   kitchen,   office   and   bedroom.
They   do   this   by   typing   commands   at   a   prompt. 
The   simulation   processes   each   command,   updates   its   state,   and   repeats.
